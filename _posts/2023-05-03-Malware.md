This contains a list of Open Source / Free Blue Team Tools that I use daily, and have stored here for reference.

## Malware Analysis
Malware Analysis is a broad scope. My aim is to extract IOC's to use for further threat hunting and detection through both static and dynamic analysis. The extracted IOC's should also be incorporated into any and all threat intelligence systems and distributed appropriately.

### What I use

I use a suite of VM's for my Analysis that references the environments that I work with. The main testing ground is done on a Windows 10 VM with no AV installed. Then another Windows 10 VM with all the corporate security tools installed. 

Alternatives to these machines include using Fire Eye's "Flare VM", which comes pre installed with many useful tools that I have not listed here. I am still in the process of testing the VM, though it does allow for easier network forensics without the use of a second VM running iNetSim.

Additionally, I recommend tracking all investigations (incident response or otherwise) inside of a tool such as 'The Hive Project' which essentially can act as an analyst notebook.
