# Reverse Engineering with Radare2

In this article, we will explore the basics of radare2, a powerful package that comes with Kali. We are going to write a simple program, and then disassemble it, to see what is really doing in the processor.

I will use Kali  and x86 (64 bits) instructions. Not all architectures have the same set of instructions (keep in mind), the most important difference is between Reduced Instruction Set Computing (embedded systems, PMDs...) and Complex Instruction Set Computing (clusters, desktop computing...). An example of RISC could be ARM and of CISC x86.

Note: this article requires some basic skills in computing, if you don't know what is a register or something like that, you probably won't understand nothing. You can first take a look to Ciuffy's series on Attack the Stack 

## Radare2

Radare2 is an open source set of tools for reverse-engineering and analysis of binary files (among other things, for example debugging). In this article we will cover two tools: rasm2 and r2.
